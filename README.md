# IAMsystem

A general purpose biomedical semantic annotation tool.
It stores your dictionary in a tree data structure and can detect abbreviations (provided by you) and typos (with Levenshtein distance) at the token level. Brat output is available. 

### Getting started

To build it, you will need Java 1.8 (or higher) JDK a recent version of Maven (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and put the `mvn` command on your path. Now you can run `mvn clean install` in the IAMsystem folder to compile the project. 

See how it works with the example (Maven project) using your favorite IDE.
